    "A measure of the diversity of the organization will be required.  If the \"non-diverse\" organization is defined as controled by a sterotypical group in charge, the sterotypical group is an older straight Eurpean male.  Then a diverse organization would be one that deviates from that sterotypical group.   \n",

    "Another definition of diversity could related to how closely the organization reflects the local populace.  Gender diversity would be expected to be near even in an organzation.  Ethnic diversity may vary based on locale, but nationally, the expectation is 64% white, 12% African-American, 5% Asian, 16% Latino.  \n",

    "The Candian government has promoted a formula for calculating diversity.  They have 4 class of of minority status: Female, person with diability, aborignal person, and visible minority.  To belong to a minority, a person must self identify in at least one minority category.  The percent diversity is number of self identified minorities divided by total headcount.\n",

    "As an aside, diversity is not the goal.  It is being used to note the inclusion of groups that have been excluded from the typical power structure.  The model of definining diversity as just based on the headcount doesn't describe the power structure of the organization.  Perhaps the weighting the \"diversity\" based on the position will better capture the diversity of the oprganization.  If the group with the least decision making authority are more diverse than levels with decision making authority, the overall diveristy should be very low.  This type of structure seems to represent the status quo rather than goal of \"increasing diversity\".\n",

    "Diversity is discussed on many levels.  It can be thought of as a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As just a description of variation of the population within a sample.\n",
    "1. As a description of the variation of a sample when compared to a general population.\n",

    "The third definition is most useful in this situation.  The goal is to quantify the inclusion of individuals from groups that have been excluded from a power structure.  I'll acknowledge this is a mixing of terms, but it is the common venacular of speaking about diversity.  In this example, a group that is composed entirely of a single minority gorup would be considered very diverse, because they are distinct from the sterotypical group.\n",
